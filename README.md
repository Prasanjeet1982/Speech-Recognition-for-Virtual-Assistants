# Speech Recognition Virtual Assistant

This project demonstrates a simple web-based speech recognition virtual assistant using FastAPI and the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

## Features

- Provides a web-based interface for users to trigger speech recognition.
- Captures audio from the microphone and recognizes speech using Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API.
- Displays the recognized text to the user.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Google Cloud account and credentials for the Speech-to-Text API
- Docker (optional)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-recognition-virtual-assistant.git
   cd speech-recognition-virtual-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your Google Cloud credentials JSON file in the `speech_recognition_app/credentials/` directory.

## Usage

1. Run the application using Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the speech recognition interface.

3. Click on the "Speak Something" button and allow microphone access to your browser.

4. After speaking, the recognized text will be displayed on the web page.

## Docker Support
